# CSE185 Spring 2018 IClicker Policy

i>Clickers are required, and you should bring them to every class. All in class quizzes as well as participation points will account for 10% of your total grade.

Participation, discussion, and anonymous voter questions will be marked in blue. Those may or may not have a correct answer, but as long as you select ANY answer you will get credit for that questions.

Quiz questions will be marked in red. You have to answer those correctly to get a point, AND they count toward the total possible questions for participation, so you should always answer even if you're not sure which is correct.

Every day that we have clicker questions, you will have the opportunity to get 1 participation point and 2 quiz points. There may be more than 2 quiz questions per session, so even if you get one wrong you may still be able to get full credit.

At the end of the quarter your 3 lowest clicker sessions will be automatically dropped. This is designed to accommodate approved, planned absences, or unexpected absences due to illness.
