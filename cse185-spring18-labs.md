# CSE185 Spring 2018 Lab Guidelines

For the first 7 weeks, we will work on a different lab assignment each week during the Tuesday and Thursday lab sessions. Lab reports are due the following Tuesday before the start of the next lab.

Each lab will require you to have access to the joint class server for data analysis and to complete a lab notebook and report using Github. Detailed instructions are given below.

## Connecting to the server

## Accessing the lab assignment on Github classroom
All lab assignments are distributed using Github classroom. Before you start, make sure you have a Github username (sign up at http://github.com).

To get up to speed on Git and Github technology, please take a look at this tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/. We'll learn various Github features throughout the course.

A link to each assignment will be posted on the course homepage (https://github.com/gymreklab/cse185-spring18). To start the assignment, simply click the link. This will automatically create a new personal repository where you can complete the assignment. Your work will only be visible to you and the instructors of the course.

The repository for the week's assignment will consist of:
* Tutorial materials (CSE_WeekX_PartX.md)
* A (mostly blank) lab notebook file (CSE185_WeekX_LabNotebook.md) for you to fill in (see below)
* A labreport folder for you to upload your final lab report and any materials you used to write it.
