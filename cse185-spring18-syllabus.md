# Course description
This course emphasizes the hands-on application of bioinformatics to biological problems. Students will gain experience in the application of existing software, as well as in combining approaches to answer specific biological questions. Sequence alignment, fast database search, comparative genomics, expression analysis, computational proteomics, genome-wide association studies, next generation sequencing, genomics and big data. This course is open to bioinformatics majors only.

## Prerequisites
CSE 11, CSE 12, MATH 20C, BILD 1, BILD 4 or BIMM 101

## Course objectives
By the end of the course, students will:

* Be able to explain why bioinformatics approaches are important to understand and interpret results in many different biological areas of study.
* Be able to utilize existing bioinformatics tools individually and in combination to analyze various kinds of biological data.
* Develop critical analysis and research skills that can be applied to understand and use new bioinformatics tools that are developed in the future.
* Be able to access publicly available datasets and bioinformatics tools.
* Learn and use accepted best practices for bioinformatics.

## Course structure
The course consists of two lectures (1 hour) and two lab sessions (2 hours) each week. Based on the time you signed up for, you will be assigned to a lab section on the first day of class.
Lectures will cover background material needed to complete the lab projects, and will have graded in-class quizzes and participation questions using iClickers.

Attendance at both lecture and lab sessions is mandatory for the course and attendance will be taken each day. In the case of a valid excuse (must be approved by the instructor before the scheduled class), points for quizzes and participation points can be made up.

For the first 7 weeks, students will work on a weekly lab project during the scheduled lab sessions. Reports for each week's project are due the following Tuesday at the start of class, and will be returned within one week. Students will additionally be responsible for maintaining an electronic notebook. For the last 3 weeks of the quarter, students will work on an independent project.

# Grading
Grades will be based on lab reports (60%), final projects (15%), lab notebooks (10%), quizzes and participation questions (10%), and attendance (5%).

At the end of the quarter your 3 lowest clicker sessions will be automatically dropped. If *all* students fill out a course evaluation at the end of the quarter, the lowest scoring weekly report will be dropped.

Final grades will be out of 100 points. >=70 points is passing. Grades will be assigned using the following scale:

A+:97-100, A:93-96, A-:90-92,
B+:87-89, B:83-86, B-:80-82,
C+:77-79, C:73-76, C-:70-72,
F:0-69.

You will lose 5% of the lab report grade for each day a report is late. This is capped after 4 days, so after 4 days your baseline score for the report is 80%. 

# Policies

## Academic integrity
During lab, while working on coding and analysis you are encouraged to chat with your classmates, look things up online, and ask instructors for help. However, when writing up your lab reports, work independently and make sure that the lab report is *in your own words* and *reflects your own understanding*. You may use scientific literature, but must cite it in the text. DO NOT directly copy/paste code to/from other students in the class or websites. DO NOT post questions about assignments on sites like seqanswers or stack overflow (you can research existing threads on these sites, just don't start new ones for the coursework). All work will be checked via turnitin. Violators of these policies may be subject to UCSD rules for academic integrity.

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting accommodations, please contact the Office for Students with Disabilities.  You must have documentation from the the Office before accommodations can be granted.

## Diversity and inclusion
We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive. 

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know, either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.  Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process, and we welcome your perspectives and input.  

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community (https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others’ backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.
